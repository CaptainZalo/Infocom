Ripped from gustavohmsilva@github and downsized.

Install-script copies ZORK 1, Zork 2, Zork 3 and Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy datafiles and installs frotz, an Infocom textadventure parser. The files can be interpreted by most text-adventure parsers. Installscript will install frotz for ease.

Run games with command "frotz /path/to/file" (Ex: "frotz ~/Infocom/ZORK1.DAT")

To uninstall, remove frotz with command "sudo apt-get remove frotz", then delete this folder.
