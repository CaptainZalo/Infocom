Installation Script for ZORK 1, Zork 2 and Zork 3 on Debian based distributions

Ripped from gustavohmsilva@github and downsized.

To install, clone repo and run ./install.sh
Run games with command "frotz /path/to/file"

(Ex: "frotz ~/Infocom/ZORK.DAT")

To uninstall remove frotz with command "sudo apt-get remove frotz", then delete this folder.

PS: This script installs frotz, and Infocom textadventure parser.
