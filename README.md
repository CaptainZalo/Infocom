#Installation Script for ZORK 1, Zork 2 and Zork 3 on Debian based distributions
#Ripped from gustavohmsilva@github and downsized.

To install, clone repo and run ./install.sh
Run games with command 'frotz /path/to/file'
(Ex: 'frotz ~/Zork/ZORK.DAT')
To uninstall, just type ./uninstall.sh

PS: This script installs frotz, and Infocom textadventure parser.
